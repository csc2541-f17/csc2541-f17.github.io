Here is some software you may find helpful for your projects:

* deep learning frameworks
    * [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (probably has the most relevant software for this course)
    * [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)
    * [Theano](http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/)
    * [Autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd) (lightweight autodiff framework; easier to experiment with than the other frameworks, but CPU-based)

* probabilistic programming languages
    * [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) (the most widely used PPL; uses HMC, but somewhat of a black box)
    * [Edward](http://edwardlib.org/) (a PPL aimed at researchers, based on HMC and stochastic variational inference)

* Gaussian processes
    * [GPy](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy)
    * [GPflow](https://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)

* Bayesian optimization
    * [Spearmint](https://github.com/HIPS/Spearmint)
    * [HPOLib](http://www.automl.org/hpolib.html)

* reinforcement learning
    * [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/)
    * [OpenAI Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines)

* adversarial robustness
    * [CleverHans](https://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans)
    * [Foolbox](https://github.com/bethgelab/foolbox)
